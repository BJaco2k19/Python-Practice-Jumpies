# Python-Practice-Jumpies
A Repository for the practice Python Projects I've done to learn and understand Python
This is mainly going to be used as a portfolio for my simple python projects I've done 
either as part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program on Coursera
or have done to otherwise demonstrate my skills in Python specifically and in programming
in general.  The projects from Google Cybersecurity Professional were made in Jupyter Notebooks 
working in Python 3, and are edited to remove the Hints lines that are provided as part of the lab
session.
